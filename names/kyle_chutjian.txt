Boating
My favorite activity is boating on the Hudson River during the summer time. This is a picture of me and my Dad on the 4th of July. We normally like to go tubing, water skiing, or just swimming. Its impossible to take a good picture on a boat without sunglasses or you will be squinting the whole time.
