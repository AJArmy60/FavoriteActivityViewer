Robotics
I really enjoy programming, and robotics was one way I could use my programming skills to do something fun. In high school, I participated on my school's robotics team for the FIRST Tech Challenge. I was a driver on the team, and we were able to make it to states in during my senior year. The picture is from one of our matches during states.
