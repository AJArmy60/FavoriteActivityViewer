Ice Hockey
I love hockey, I have played it my whole life. I have played at a very high level youth hockey and even spoke to D1 coaches. Unfortunately, I decided to not pursue my love for ice hockey and decided to go to college. However I still love to watch and sometimes play the game I love so much.
