Robotics
I enjoy programming, and robotics let me use programming to accomplish a goal. I participated on my high school robotics team in the First Tech Challenge, serving as the lead programmer and as the coach of our driving team. While I was in charge of telling the drivers what they needed to do, my coaching role really allowed me to resolve any software issues which inevitably occurred at tournaments. The picture is of me with one of my friends and my brother driving the robot at a tournament.
